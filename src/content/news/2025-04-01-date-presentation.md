I presented our paper **"Tempus Core: Area-Power Efficient Temporal-Unary Convolution Core for Low-Precision Edge DLAs"** at DATE 2025 in Lyon, France.

Tempus Core is an INT8 temporal-unary convolution core designed for NVDLA (NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator) that achieves:
- 53% area reduction
- 44% power reduction
- 5x iso-area throughput improvement

DATE (Design, Automation and Test in Europe) is a premier conference in electronic design automation and embedded systems.
