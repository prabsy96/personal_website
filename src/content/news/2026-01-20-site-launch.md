I'm excited to announce the launch of my new personal research website!

## What's New

This website serves as a central hub for my research, projects, and professional updates. Here you'll find:

- **Research**: Publications, preprints, and information about my ongoing research projects
- **Projects**: Open-source software, tools, and code repositories
- **News**: Updates about papers, talks, and other milestones

## Built with Astro

The site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build), a modern static site generator that prioritizes performance and simplicity. The design focuses on readability and easy access to content, following academic website conventions.

Feel free to explore the site and [reach out](/contact) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations.
