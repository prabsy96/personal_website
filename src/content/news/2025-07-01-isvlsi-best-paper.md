Our paper **"Catwalk: Unary Top-K for Efficient Ramp-No-Leak Neuron Design for Temporal Neural Networks"** received the **Amar Mukherjee Best Paper Award** at ISVLSI 2025.

This work, co-authored with Drew Lister, Prof. John Paul Shen, and Prof. Di Wu, presents a novel unary-based Top-K implementation for efficient neuron design in Temporal Neural Networks.

The Amar Mukherjee Best Paper Award is the highest recognition for papers presented at the IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI.
