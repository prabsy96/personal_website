I delivered an invited talk on **"Characterizing and Optimizing LLM Inference Workloads on CPU-GPU Coupled Architectures"** at the Jülich Supercomputing Center (JSC) in Germany.

This talk presented our findings on LLM inference performance bottlenecks on NVIDIA GH200 and other CPU-GPU coupled architectures, and the SKIP profiling tool we developed during my internship at Samsung Semiconductor.

JSC is one of Europe's leading supercomputing centers and part of the Forschungszentrum Jülich research institute.
