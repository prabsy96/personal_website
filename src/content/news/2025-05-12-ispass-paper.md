I presented our paper **"Characterizing and Optimizing LLM Inference Workloads on CPU-GPU Coupled Architectures"** at ISPASS 2025 in Ghent, Belgium.

This work, conducted during my internship at Samsung Semiconductor, analyzes the performance characteristics of large language model inference on NVIDIA GH200 and traditional PCIe-connected CPU-GPU systems. We demonstrated that GH200 incurs 2.8x more prefill latency compared to Intel x86 CPU - H100 GPU systems.

Co-authors include Tyler Labonte, Sumit Chakraborty, Matthew Turner, Srinath Sury, and Prof. John Paul Shen.
