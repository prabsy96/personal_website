Our paper **"Mugi: Value Level Parallelism for Efficient LLMs"** has been accepted at ASPLOS 2026.

This work, in collaboration with David Price, Prof. John Paul Shen, and Prof. Di Wu, introduces a novel architecture for efficient large language model inference through value level parallelism.

ASPLOS (Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems) is a premier venue for computer architecture research.
